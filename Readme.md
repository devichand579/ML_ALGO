# ML AlGO
This repository contains code for implementations of three different tasks based on :
1. Email Spam Classification
2. Breast cancer cell Classification
3. Pruning Decision trees and Cross-Validation

## 1. Email Spam Classification
Two different Algorithms were used to Classify Spam Emails.
1. Support Vector machines 
2. Naive Bayes Classifier

## 2. Breast cancer cell Classification
A sequnetial Neural Network with four Convolution layers followed by a Dense layer allowing us to classify the images accurately.

## 3. Pruning Decision trees and Cross-Validation
Performed Reduced Error pruning on the originally obtained decision tree trained on the given dataset and finally visualised the differences between original decision tree and pruned decision tree.
