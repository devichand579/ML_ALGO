This repository contains code for implementations of different tasks based on :
1. Email Spam Classification
2. Breast cancer cell Classification
3. Pruning Decision trees and Cross-Validation
4. Stock Market Simulation
5. Regression

## 1. Email Spam Classification
Two different Algorithms were used to Classify Spam Emails.
1. Support Vector machines 
2. Naive Bayes Classifier

## 2. Breast cancer cell Classification
A sequnetial Neural Network with four Convolution layers followed by a Dense layer allowing us to classify the images accurately.

## 3. Pruning Decision trees and Cross-Validation
Performed Reduced Error pruning on the originally obtained decision tree trained on the given dataset and finally visualised the differences between original decision tree and pruned decision tree.

## 4. Stock Market Simulation
Created Stock market simulation with various classes for handling various tasks and entities of the system while also maintaining volatality of the created stock market instance with users being able to perform live transactions 

## 5.Regression
This directory contains implementation of both linear regression and logistic regression algorithms from scratch. Refer to the problem statement for further information
